Dear friends,

I am writing to inform you about the IT problem you are experiencing:

Excel: The program encountered a problem and shut down unexpectedly. To fix it, I helped you reinstall Excel.

Database: The database is not working properly and is not responding to requests. I have reinstalled the database for you, it should run normally again now

Projector: The projector does not display any images. I repaired the projector, reinstalled the projector's image.
Let me know if you have any further problems.

Best regards,
Phuoc
